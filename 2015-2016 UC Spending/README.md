# 2015-2016 UC Spending Project

Made by Emily Jia, up-to-date UC data available at https://uc.fas.harvard.edu/grants/finance-committee-records/

Undergraduate Council Master Spreadsheet is example of publically available data

UC Data.Rdata is data that can be loaded into R (I had some trouble with exporting the original spreadsheet to csv, this should make future work faster)

ru.csv is data of ratio of allocated: requested for retroactive vs. upfront grants

UC Script.R shows how figures and data were generated for the report
